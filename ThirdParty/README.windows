When building for Windows, you can drop the following into ThirdParty directory to get automatically picked up by CMake:

ThirdParty/glew/msvc2016-win64/include/glew/..
ThirdParty/glew/msvc2016-win64/lib/... (static glew libs)

ThirdParty/glfw3/msvc2016-win64/include/glfw/..
ThirdParty/glfw3/msvc2016-win64/lib/... (static glfw libs)

Obviously, if building with a different compiler or architecture, this won't work and you'll have to manually
point CMake at your glew and glfw distributions when running CMake.
